**AI Evaluation** is an application dedicated to the comparative analysis of images generated by different AIs. For this purpose, four distinct models were selected. Each of them creates images from the same prompt, and it's up to you to evaluate which one was the best through your vote.

After the evaluation, the results are available for viewing, showing which services performed best. Additionally, you can compare your evaluation with ChatGPT's own, which also analyzes the generated images.

<sub>The models and their documentation can be updated after the project is completed. The information presented refers to the period of June 2025.</sub>

## 🛠️ Installation and Execution

The application was developed in **Python 3.10**, and it is recommended to use this version to ensure compatibility. To configure it, follow these instructions from the project's root directory.

### 1️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Before installing and running the application, it is necessary to configure the access keys to the AI ​​services as environment variables. To do this, create a `.env` file, based on `.env.example`, and assign the values ​​for `GEMINI_KEY`, `OPENAI_KEY`, `RUNWARE_KEY`, and `STABILITY_AI_KEY`.

### 2️⃣ Install the Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
python -m app
```

<sub>The images are generated during the server's initial startup, which causes a longer waiting time. This process only occurs once, unless the database is deleted.</sub>

## 🚀 Workflow

The application works through three main stages that occur sequentially and are interdependent.

### 🖼️ Image Generation

On the first execution of the application, the `generation_entries.json` file is read to retrieve the `group`, `theme`, and `prompt` attributes. From this information, requests are made to each AI service in random order. The generated images are saved in the SQLite database, located in the project root, and stored as PNG files in the `static/img` directory.

Se o banco de dados apresentar registros de imagem, essa etapa é ignorada em execuções futuras.

### 🤖 ChatGPT Review

After generation, the images are evaluated by ChatGPT. They are grouped and sent without the name of the generating model, containing only the identifier and binary content. For each group, one image is chosen as the best, and the result is recorded in the database.

This step is also skipped in future executions if there is already a record of evaluation done by ChatGPT.

### 👤 User Review

With the ChatGPT images and ratings ready, the user can access the application interface and vote for the best images via prompt. The process is intuitive and at the end it is possible to view:

- Number of votes per AI (ChatGPT and user);

- Total and average image size per AI;

- Total and average generation time per AI.
